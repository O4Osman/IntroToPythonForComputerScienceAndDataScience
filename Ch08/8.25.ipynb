    "The President. Your bedtime reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tony! Thank you. Looking for Jill.\n",

    "Good evening. Good evening. If I were smart, I'd go home now. [Laughter]\n",

    "Mr. Speaker, Madam Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: In January 1941, Franklin Roosevelt came to this Chamber to speak to the Nation. And he said, \"I address you at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union.\" Hitler was on the march. War was raging in Europe. President Roosevelt's purpose was to wake up Congress and alert the American people that this was no ordinary time. Freedom and democracy were under assault in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tonight I come to the same Chamber to address the Nation. Now it's we who face an unprecedented moment in the history of the Union. And yes, my purpose tonight is to wake up the Congress and alert the American people that this is no ordinary moment either. Not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault at home as they are today.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes our moment rare is that freedom and democracy are under attack at both at home and overseas at the very same time. Overseas, Putin of Russia is on the march, invading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe and beyond. If anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you: He will not.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Ukraine [applause]. Ukraine can stop Putin. Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons that it needs to defend itself. That is all that is all Ukraine is asking. They're not asking for American soldiers. In fact, there are no American soldiers at war in Ukraine, and I'm determined to keep it that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "But now assistance to Ukraine is being blocked by those who want to walk away from our world leadership. It wasn't long ago when a Republican President named Ronald Reagan thundered, \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\" Now [applause]. Now my predecessor, a former Republican President, tells Putin, quote, \"Do whatever the hell you want.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Audience members. Boo!\n",
    "\n",
    "The President. That's a quote. A former President actually said that, bowing down to a Russian leader. I think it's outrageous, it's dangerous, and it's unacceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "America is a founding member of NATO, the military alliance of democratic nations created after World War II prevent to prevent war and keep the peace. And today we've made NATO stronger than ever. We welcomed Finland to the alliance last year. And just this morning Sweden officially joined, and their Minister is here tonight. Come here, stand up. Welcome. Welcome, welcome, welcome. And they know how to fight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Prime Minister, welcome to NATO, the strongest military alliance the world has ever seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "I say this to Congress: We have to stand up to Putin. Send me a bipartisan national security bill. History is literally watching. History is watching. If the United States walks away, it will put Ukraine at risk. Europe is at risk. The free world will be at risk, emboldening others to do what they wish to do us harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "My message to President Putin, who I've known for a long time, is simple: We will not walk away. We will not bow down. I will not bow down.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a literal sense, history is watching. History is watching, just like history watched 3 years ago on January 6, when insurrectionists stormed this very Capitol and placed a dagger to the throat of American democracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of you were here on that darkest of days. We all saw with our own eyes, the insurrectionists were not patriots. They had come to stop the peaceful transfer of power, to overturn the will of the people.\n",
    "\n",
    "January 6 lies about the 2020 election and the plots to steal the election posed a great gravest threat to U.S. democracy since the Civil War. But they failed. America stood [applause]. America stood strong, and democracy prevailed. We must be honest: The threat to democracy must be defended [defeated; White House correction].\n",
    "\n",
    "My predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth about January 6. I will not do that. This is a moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies. Here's the simple truth: You can't love your country only when you win.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I've done ever since being elected to office, I ask all of you, without regard to party, to join together and defend democracy. Remember your oath of office to defend against all threats foreign and domestic. Respect respect free and fair elections, restore trust in our institutions, and make clear political violence has absolutely no place no place in America. Zero place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, it's not hyperbole to suggest history is watching. They're watching. Your children and grandchildren will read about this day and what we do.\n",
    "\n",
    "History is watching another assault on freedom. Joining us tonight is Latorya Beasley, a social worker from Birmingham, Alabama.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourteen months ago fourteen months ago, she and her husband welcomed a baby girl thanks to the miracle of IVF. She scheduled treatments to have that second child, but the Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the State, unleashed by a Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. She was told her dream would have to wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "What her family had gone through should never have happened. Unless Congress acts, it could happen again. So tonight let's stand up for families like hers. To my friends across the aisle, don't keep this waiting any longer. Guarantee the right to IVF. Guarantee it nationwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right.\n",
    "\n",
    "I thank Vice President Harris for being an incredible leader defending reproductive freedom and so much more. [Applause] Thank you.\n",
    "\n",
    "My predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. He's the reason it was overturned, and he brags about it. Look at the chaos that has resulted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joining us tonight is Kate Cox, a wife and mother from Dallas. She'd become pregnant again and had a fetus with a fatal condition. Her doctor told Kate that her own life and her ability to have future in the children in the future were at risk if she didn't act. Because Texas law banned her ability to act, Kate and her husband had to leave the State to get what she needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "What her family had gone through should have never happened as well. But it's happening to too many others. There are State laws banning the freedom to choose, criminalizing doctors, forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their States to get the treatment they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of you in this Chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Audience members. Boo!\n",
    "\n",
    "The President. My God, what freedom else would you take away?\n",
    "\n",
    "Look, its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court majority wrote the following and with all due respect, Justices \"Women are not without electoral power\" excuse me\" electoral or political power.\" You're about to realize just how much you were right about that.\n",
    "Clearly [applause]. Clearly, those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women. But they found out. When reproductive freedom was on the ballot, we won in 2022 and 2023. And we'll win again in 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you if you, the American people send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folks, America cannot go back.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am here tonight to show what I believe is the way forward, because I know how far we've come. Four years ago next week, before I came to office, the country was hit by the worst pandemic and the worst economic crisis in a century. Remember the fear, record losses?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the spikes in crime and the murder rate? A raging virus that took more than 1 million American lives of loved ones, millions left behind. A mental health crisis of isolation and loneliness.\n",
    "\n",
    "A President, my predecessor, failed in the most basic Presidential duty that he owes to American people: the duty to care.\n",
    "\n",
    "Representative Derrick Van Orden. Lies!\n",
    "\n",
    "The President. I think that's unforgivable.\n",
    "\n",
    "I came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in the Nation's history. We have. It doesn't make new, but in a news in a thousand cities and towns, the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's tell the story here tell it here and now. America's comeback is building a future of American possibilities; building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down; investing in all of America, in all Americans to make every sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one no one behind.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandemic no longer controls our lives. The vaccine that saved us from COVID is are now being used to beat cancer. Turning setback into comeback that's what America does. That's what America does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folks, I inherited an economy that was on the brink. Now, our economy is literally the envy of the world: 15 million new jobs in just 3 years a record, a record; unemployment at 50-year lows.\n",
    "\n",
    "A record 16 million Americans are starting small businesses, and each one is a literal act of hope, with historic job growth and small-business growth for Black and Hispanics and Asian Americans. Eight hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs in America and counting. Where is it written we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world? We are, and we will.\n",
    "\n",
    "More people have health insurance today [applause]. More people have health insurance today than ever before. The racial wealth gap is the smallest it's been in 20 years. Wages keep going up. Inflation keeps coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9 percent to 3 percent, the lowest in the world and tending [trending; White House correction] lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "The landing is and will be soft. And now, instead of importing foreign products and exporting American jobs, we're exporting American products and creating American jobs, right here in America, where they belong.\n",
    "\n",
    "And it takes time, but the American people are beginning to feel it. Consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Buy America\" has been the law of the land since the 1930s. Past administrations, including my predecessor including some Democrats, as well, in the past failed to buy American. Not anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "On my watch, Federal projects that you fund like helping build American roads, bridges, and highways will be made with American products and built by American workers, creating good-paying American jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "And thanks to our CHIPS and Science Act, the United States is investing more in research and development than ever before. During the pandemic, a shortage of semiconductors, chips that drove up the price of everything from cell phones to automobiles and by the way, we invented those chips right here in America.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, instead of having to import them, instead of private companies are now investing billions of dollars to build new chip factories here in America, creating tens of thousands of jobs, many of those jobs paying $100,000 a year and don't require a college degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, my policies have attracted $650 billion in private-sector investment in clean energy, advanced manufacturing, creating tens of thousands of jobs here in America. And thanks [applause]. And thanks to our bipartisan infrastructure law, 46,000 new projects have been announced all across your communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "And by the way, I noticed some of you who've strongly voted against it are there cheering on that money coming in. [Laughter] And I like it. I'm with you. I'm with you. And if any of you don't want that money in your district, just let me know. [Laughter]\n",
    "\n",
    "Modernizing our roads and bridges, ports and airports, public transit systems; removing poisonous lead pipes so every child can drink clean water without risk of brain damage; providing affordable affordable high-speed internet for every American, no matter where you live urban, suburban, or rural communities in red States and blue States; record investments in Tribal communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of my investment in family farms [applause] because I invested in family farms led by my Secretary of Agriculture, who knows more about this than anybody I know we're better able to stay in the family for the those farms so their and their children and grandchildren won't have to leave home to make a living. It's transformative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The great comeback story is Belvidere, Illinois. Home to an auto plant for nearly 60 years. Before I came to office, the plant was on its way to shutting down. Thousands of workers feared for their livelihoods. Hope was fading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I was elected to office, and we raised the Belvidere repeatedly with auto companies, knowing unions would make all the difference. The UAW worked like hell to keep the plant open and get these jobs back. And together, we succeeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of auto factories shutting down, auto factories are reopening, and a new state-of-the-art battery factory is being built to power those cars there at the same [applause]. Folks [applause]. To the folks of Belvidere, I say: Instead of your town being left behind, your community is moving forward again. Because instead of watching auto jobs of the future go overseas, 4,000 union jobs with higher wages are building a future in Belvidere right here in America.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here tonight is UAW President Shawn Fain, a great friend and a great labor leader. Shawn, where are you? Stand up. And Dawn and Dawn Simms, a third-generation worker UAW worker at Belvidere. Shawn, I was proud to be the first President to stand in the picket line. And today, Dawn has a good job in her hometown, providing stability for her family and pride and dignity as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Showing once again, Wall Street didn't build America. They're not bad guys. They didn't build it, though. The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class.\n",
    "\n",
    "I say to the American people: When America gets knocked down, we get back up. We keep going. That's America. That's you, the American people. It's because of you America is coming back. It's because of you our future is brighter. It's because of you that tonight we can proudly say the state of our Union is strong and getting stronger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\n",
    "\n",
    "The President. Tonight tonight, I want to talk about the future of possibilities that we can build together, a future where the days of trickle-down economics are over and the wealthy and the biggest corporations no longer get the all the tax breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "And by the way, I understand corporations. I come from a State that has more corporations invested [laughter] than every one of your States in the State the United States combined. And I represented it for 36 years. I'm not anticorporation.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I grew up in a home where trickle-down economics didn't put much on my dad's kitchen table. That's why I determined to turn things around so the middle class does well. When they do well, the poor have a way up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.\n",
    "\n",
    "And there's more to do to make sure you're feeling the benefits of all we're doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anywhere in the world. It's wrong, and I'm ending it. With a law that I proposed and signed and not one of your Republican buddies work voted for it we finally beat Big Pharma. Instead of paying $400 a month or thereabouts for insulin with diabetes and it only costs 10 bucks to make they only get paid $35 a month now and still make a healthy profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "And I want to and what to do next, I want to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "For years, people have talked about it. But finally, we got it done and gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices on prescription drugs, just like the VA is able to do for veterans.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's not just saving seniors money. It's saving taxpayers money. We cut the Federal deficit by $160 billion, because Medicare will no longer have to pay those exorbitant prices to Big Pharma.\n",
    "\n",
    "This year, Medicare is negotiating lower prices for some of the costliest drugs on the market that treat everything from heart disease to arthritis. It's now time to go further and give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for 500 different drugs over the next decade.\n",
    "\n",
    "They're making a lot of money, guys. And they'll still be extremely profitable. It will not only save lives, it will save taxpayers another $200 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting next year, the same law caps total prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $200 at $2,000 a year, even for expensive cancer drugs that cost $10-, $12-, $15,000. Now I want to cap prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year for everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folks, I'm going to get in trouble for saying that, but any of you want to get in Air Force One with me and fly to Toronto, Berlin, Moscow I mean, excuse me. [Laughter] Well, even Moscow, probably. [Laughter] And bring your prescription with you, and I promise you, I'll get it for you for 40-percent the cost you're paying now. Same company, same drug, same place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folks, the Affordable Care Act the old \"Obamacare\" is still a very big deal. [Laughter] Over 100 million of you can no longer be denied health insurance because of a preexisting condition. But my predecessor and many in this Chamber want to take the that prescription drug away by repealing Affordable Care Act.\n",
    "\n",
    "Audience members. Boo!\n",
    "\n",
    "The President. I'm not going to let that happen. We stopped you 50 times before, and we'll stop you again.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, I'm not only protecting it, I'm expanding it. The we enacted tax credits of $800 per person per year [to; White House correction] reduce health care costs for millions of working families. That tax credit expires next year. I want to make that savings permanent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To state the obvious: Women are more than half of our population, but research on women's health has always been underfunded. That's why we're launching the first ever White House Initiative on Women's Health Research, led by Jill doing an incredible job as First Lady to pass my plan for $12 billion to transform women's health research and benefit millions of lives all across America.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know the cost of housing is so important to you. If inflation keeps coming down, mortgage rates will come down as well, and the Fed acknowledges that.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I'm not waiting. I want to provide an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month for the next 2 years as mortgage rates come down to put toward their mortgages when they buy their first home or trade up for a little more space. Just for 2 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "And my administration is also eliminating title insurance [fees; White House correction] on federally backed mortgages. When you refinance your home, you can save $1,000 or more as a consequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For millions of renters, we're cracking down on big landlords who use antitrust law using antitrust who break antitrust laws by price-fixing and driving up rents. We've cut redtape so builders can get federally financing, which is already helping build a record 1.7 million new house housing units nationwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now pass [applause] now pass [my plan; White House correction] and build and renovate 2 million affordable homes and bring those rents down.\n",
    "\n",
    "To remain the strongest economy in the world, we need to have the best education system in the world. And I, like I suspect all of you, want to give a child every child a good start by providing access to preschool for 3- and 4-years-old.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know, I think I pointed out last year [applause]. I think I pointed out last year that children coming from broken homes where there's no books, they're not read to, not spoken to very often start school kindergarten or first grade hearing having heard a million fewer words spoken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, studies show that children who go to preschool are nearly 50-percent more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- and 4-year degree no matter what their background is.\n",
    "\n",
    "I met a year and a half ago with the leaders of the Business Roundtable. They were mad that I was ever angry I well, they were discussing [laughter] why I wanted to spend money on education.\n",
    "\n",
    "I pointed out to them: As Vice President, I met with over eight I think it was 182 of those folks don't hold me to the exact number and I asked them what they need most the CEOs. And you've had the same experience on both sides of the aisle. They say, \"A better educated workforce,\" right?\n",
    "\n",
    "So I looked at them. And I say: \"I come from Delaware. DuPont used to be the eighth largest corporation in the world. And every new enterprise they bought, they educated the workforce to that enterprise. But none of you do that anymore. Why are you angry with me providing you the opportunity for the best educated workforce in the world?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "And they all looked at me and said, \"I think you're right.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to expand high-quality tutoring and summer learning to see that every child learns to read by third grade. I'm also connecting local businesses and high schools so students get hands-on experience and a path to a good-paying job whether or not they go to college.\n",
    "\n",
    "And I want to make sure that college is more affordable. Let's continue increasing the Pell grants to working and middle class families and increase record investments in HBCUs and minority-serving institutions, including Hispanic institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I was told I couldn't universally just change the way in which we did dealt with student loans, I fixed two student loan programs that already existed to reduce the burden of student debt for nearly 4 million Americans, including nurses, firefighters, and others in public service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Keenan Jones, a public educator in Minnesota, who's here with us tonight. Keenan, where are you? Keenan, thank you. He's educated hundreds of students so they can go to college. Now he's able to help, after debt forgiveness, get his own daughter to college.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, folks, look, such relief is good for the economy because folks are now able to buy a home, start a business, start a family.\n",
    "\n",
    "And while we're at it, I want to give public school teachers a raise.\n",
    "\n",
    "And by the way, the first couple of years, we cut the deficit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let me speak to the question of fundamental fairness for all Americans. I've been delivering real results in fiscally responsible ways. We've already cut the Federal deficit [laughter]. We've already cut the Federal deficit over $1 trillion.\n",
    "\n",
    "I signed a bipartisan deal to cut another trillion dollars in the next decade. It's my goal to cut the Federal deficit another $3 trillion by making big corporations and the very wealthy finally beginning to pay their fair share.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look, I'm a capitalist. If you want to make or can make a million or millions of bucks, that's great. Just pay your fair share in taxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fair Tax Code is how we invest in things that make this country great: health care, education, defense, and so much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here's the deal. The last administration enacted a $2 trillion tax cut overwhelmingly benefit the top 1 percent the very wealthy\n",
    "\n",
    "Audience members. Boo!\n",
    "\n",
    "The President. and the biggest corporations and exploded the Federal deficit.\n",
    "\n",
    "They added more to the national debt than any Presidential term in American history. Check the numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folks at home, does anybody really think the Tax Code is fair?\n",
    "\n",
    "Audience members. No!\n",
    "\n",
    "The President. Do you really think the wealthy and big corporations need another $2 trillion tax break?\n",
    "\n",
    "Audience members. No!\n",
    "\n",
    "The President. I sure don't. I'm going to keep fighting like hell to make it fair. Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in Federal taxes nobody not one penny. And they haven't yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the child tax credit I passed during the pandemic cut taxes for millions of working families and cut child poverty in half. Restore that child tax credit. No child should go hungry in this country.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to make the Tax Code fair is to make big corporations and the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share. Remember in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion and paid zero in Federal income tax. Zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Audience members. Boo!\n",
    "\n",
    "The President. Not anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to the law I wrote and we signed, big companies now have to pay a minimum of 15 percent. But that's still less than working people pay in Federal taxes. It's time to raise the corporate minimum tax to at least 21 percent so every big corporation finally begins to pay their fair share.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also want to end tax breaks for Big Pharma, Big Oil, private jets, massive executive pay when it was only supposed to be a million a million dollars that could be deducted. They can pay them $20 million if they want, but deduct a million. End it now.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know, there are 1,000 billionaires in America. You know what the average Federal tax is for those billionaires?\n",
    "\n",
    "Audience member. Zero!\n",
    "\n",
    "The President. No. [Laughter] They're making great sacrifices 8.2 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Audience members. Boo!\n",
    "\n",
    "The President. That's far less than the vast majority of Americans pay. No billionaire should pay a lower Federal tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker, or a nurse.\n",
    "\n",
    "I proposed a minimum tax for billionaires of 25 percent just 25 percent. You know what that would raise? That would raise $500 billion over the next 10 years.\n",

    "As we look to the future, the only real solution to the situation is a two-state solution over time. And I say this as a lifelong supporter of Israel, my entire career. No one has a stronger record with Israel than I do. I challenge any of you here. I'm the only American President to visit Israel in wartime.\n",

    "But there is no other path that guarantees Israel's security and democracy. There is no other path that guarantees that Palestinians can live in peace with with peace and dignity. And there is no other path that guarantees peace between Israel and all of its neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, with whom I'm talking.\n",

    "America is rising. We have the best economy in the world. And since I've come to office, our GTB [GDP; White House correction] is up, our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest point in over a decade. And we're standing up against China's unfair economic practices.\n",

Many of them don't come home, but we owe them and their families support.\n",

    "My lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy, a future based on core values that have defined America honesty, decency, dignity, and equality to respect everyone; to give everyone a fair shot; to give hate no safe harbor.\n",

    "Now, other people my age see it differently. [Laughter] The American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution.\n",
    "\n",

    "I watched in horror as two of my heroes like many of you did Dr. King and Bobby Kennedy, were assassinated. And their legacies inspired me to pursue a career of service.\n",
    "\n",
    "I left a law firm and became a public defender because my city of Wilmington was the only city in America occupied by the National Guard after Dr. King was assassinated because of the riots. And I became a county councilman almost by accident.\n",

    "I got elected to the United States Senate when I had no intention of running, at age 29. Then Vice President to our first Black President. Now a President to the first woman Vice President. In my career, I've been told I was too young. [Laughter] By the way, they didn't let me on the Senate elevators for votes sometimes. They not a joke. [Laughter]\n",
    "\n",
    "And I've been told I am too old. [Laughter] Whether young or old, I've always been known I've always known what endures. I've known our North Star. The very idea of America is that we're all created equal deserves to be treated equally throughout our lives.\n",

    "We've never fully lived up to that idea, but we've never walked away from it either. And I won't walk away from it now.\n",

    "Tonight you've heard mine. I see a future where [we're; White House correction] defending democracy, you don't diminish it. I see a future where we restore the right to choose and protect our freedoms, not take them away. I see a future where the middle class has finally has a fair shot and the wealthy have to pay their fair share in taxes. I see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence.\n",
