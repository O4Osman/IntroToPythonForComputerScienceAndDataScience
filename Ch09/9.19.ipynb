    "There are many issues you must resolve to get even the most straightforward crossword-puzzle-generator application working. For example, how do you represent the grid of squares \n",
    "of a crossword puzzle inside the computer? Consider using a two-dimen￾sional list where each element is one square. Some of those elements will be “black” and some will be \n",
    "“white.” Some of the “white” cells will include a number that corresponds to a number in your across and down clues.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need a source of words (i.e., a computerized dictionary) that can be directly ref￾erenced by the script. In what form should these words be stored to facilitate the complex\n",
    "manipulations required by the application? Consider using a Python dictionary for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll want to generate the clues portion of the puzzle, in which the word definitions for each across and down word are printed. Merely printing a version of the blank puzzle\n",
    "itself is not a simple problem, especially if you’d like the black-squared regions to be sym￾metric as they often are in published crossword puzzles.\n",
